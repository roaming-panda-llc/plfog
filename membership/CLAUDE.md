# membership app

Core domain models for Past Lives Makerspace.

## Models

| Model | Key fields | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `MembershipPlan` | name, monthly_price, deposit_required | Tiers (e.g. "Standard $50/mo") |
| `Member` | `_pre_signup_email`, status, member_type, fog_role, membership_plan | Primary actor; links 1:1 to User. Read emails via `member.primary_email` — see the Email Model section below. |
| `MemberEmail` | member FK, email | Pre-signup staging table; migrated to allauth EmailAddress on User link |
| `Guild` | name, is_active, guild_lead FK, about | Interest guild; receives funding votes |
| `VotePreference` | member 1:1, guild_1st/2nd/3rd FK | One per member; auto-syncs to Airtable |
| `FundingSnapshot` | cycle_label, funding_pool, results JSON | Immutable calc; created via `FundingSnapshot.take()` |
| `Space` | space_id, space_type, status, size_sqft | Physical space; read from Airtable |
| `Lease` | GenericFK tenant (Member or Guild), space FK | Active when start_date≤today and end_date null/≥today |

## Email Model — Three Stores (IMPORTANT)

Three places an email can live for a Member. Future agents MUST understand which is authoritative when. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-07-user-email-aliases-design.md` for the full rationale.

| Store | Role |
|---|---|
| `Member._pre_signup_email` (DB column `email`, accessed via `db_column="email"`) | Source of truth ONLY when `Member.user` is None (Airtable-imported members who haven't signed up yet). |
| `allauth.account.EmailAddress` | Source of truth for any Member with a linked User. Owns login, verification, and the primary flag. |
| `User.email` | Mirror kept in sync by allauth. Never read or write directly from app code. |

### Reading "the" email
- Use `member.primary_email` (property). It returns the live value: primary `EmailAddress.email` for linked members, `_pre_signup_email` otherwise, with a final fallback to `user.email`.
- **Exception:** `airtable_sync/` reads `_pre_signup_email` directly because Airtable is the external source of truth for unlinked members and we don't want sync to re-enter allauth.

### Writing (user-facing)
- Members manage their own emails at `/accounts/email/` (themed `templates/account/email.html` over allauth's built-in `account_email` view).
- Admin: the `MemberEmailInline` is **only** shown for unlinked members. Once linked, it's hidden because allauth.EmailAddress is now the truth.

### Login
- Allauth login-by-code looks up any verified `EmailAddress` row, so any verified alias works automatically.
- Pre-signup aliases imported into `MemberEmail` are promoted to `EmailAddress` when the user signs up — handled by `MemberEmail.objects.migrate_to_user(user)`, called from the `ensure_user_has_member` signal.

## Airtable Sync

`Member`, `Space`, and `Lease` are **read from Airtable** via `airtable_pull` management command. They do NOT sync back — treat as read-only from Django's perspective. `airtable_record_id` fields link to Airtable rows.

`VotePreference` and `FundingSnapshot` sync **to Airtable** on save (outbound only).

## Fog Roles → Django Permissions

`Member.set_fog_role()` calls `sync_user_permissions()` which sets:
- `admin` → `is_superuser=True`, `is_staff=True`
- `guild_officer` → `is_superuser=False`, `is_staff=True`
- `member` → both False

Never set `is_staff`/`is_superuser` directly — always go through `set_fog_role()`.

## Key QuerySet Methods

- `Member.objects.active()` — status=ACTIVE
- `Member.objects.paying()` — member_type=STANDARD
- `Member.objects.with_lease_totals()` — annotates active_lease_count, total_monthly_rent
- `Space.objects.available()` — status=AVAILABLE
- `Space.objects.with_revenue()` — annotates active_lease_rent_total
- `Lease.objects.active(as_of=date)` — start_date≤date and (end_date null or ≥date)

## Vote Calculator

`membership/vote_calculator.py` — `calculate_results(votes, paying_voter_count, pool_override)` returns a dict with per-guild allocations. Called by `FundingSnapshot.take()`.

`membership/cycle.py` — `get_cycle_context()` returns current cycle label/dates for template display.

## Signals

`membership/signals.py` — post-save signal on User to sync permissions when user is updated outside of fog_role flow. Prefer calling `member.sync_user_permissions()` directly.

## Factories

`tests/membership/factories.py` — `MemberFactory`, `GuildFactory`, `LeaseFactory`, `MembershipPlanFactory`, etc.
