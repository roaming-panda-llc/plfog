    Gated on ``created=True``: every branch of this signal is only meaningful
    on the first save of a User. Re-running ``migrate_to_user`` on subsequent
    saves was a 1.4.0 bug — it would force-re-promote ``Member._pre_signup_email``
    to primary and silently revert any other primary the member or admin had
    set via allauth, because allauth's ``set_as_primary`` calls ``user.save()``
    internally. Skipping non-creation saves keeps allauth's primary stable.
