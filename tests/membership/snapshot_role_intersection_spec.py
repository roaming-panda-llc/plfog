"""Specs that lock in the new snapshot semantics and role-intersection behavior.

See docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-09-funding-snapshot-overhaul.md.

The schema already makes ``Member.member_type`` and ``Member.fog_role`` fully
orthogonal fields — a guild officer can be work-trade, an admin can be an
employee, etc. These specs prove that:

1. Non-paying officer votes count toward guild allocation but don't contribute
   to the funding pool.
2. Paying officer votes count toward both.
3. The $1,000 minimum pool floor kicks in correctly at the boundaries.
4. ``raw_votes`` is populated with denormalized role info so the analyzer can
   re-slice historical snapshots.
